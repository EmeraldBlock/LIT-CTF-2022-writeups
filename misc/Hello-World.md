## Chall

Here's an easy CTF problem for demonstration purposes. I will go get some caesar salad while you solve this.

## Solution

By far the most difficult challenge on the CTF, we were given a very intimidating text file with some weird characters. After hours of thinking we finally realized caesar salad was a hint that we should research about leafy greens!

After a dead end on a lead we were confident on, we learned about the great Roman Julius Caesar! We spent about a day researching all his geopolitical ideas and his conquers.

Weirdly this led us to yet another dead end, and by that time we realized this was actually a hint at Caesar ciphers. Using some basic online tools we found the flag! A cool example is this brute force caesar cipher we found on this [github site](https://watchbutdonotlearn.github.io/).

## Flag
`LITCTF{W3lc0m3_T0_L1TCTF}`
