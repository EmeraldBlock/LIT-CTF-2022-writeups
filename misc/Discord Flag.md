# misc/Discord Flag

## Challenge

Go to our discord server https://discord.gg/k6yzFdZ for the flag~ We post the latest information and updates there so it's very important.

## Solution

We originally thought this was a trick to make us succumb to being Discord users. Maybe it is, but it turns out they were being legit about it. A bit before the CTF started, CodeTiger posted
> ```
> LITCTF{L1T_1S_G0NNA_BE_S0_LIT_W1TH_Y0U_GUYS!}
> ```
in the [`#announcements` channel](https://discord.com/channels/738848412912451695/738863205048123403/999912370921033778). Turns out, that was the flag!
