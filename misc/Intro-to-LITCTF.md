# misc/Into to LITCTF

## Chall

Welcome to your first CTF Challenge! For this problem, you need to first read the [CTF Resource page](https://lit.lhsmathcs.org/ctfres) and find the first half of the flag :D. The second half of the flag can be found at our [Opening Ceremony!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QCkheqOp3s&ab_channel=LexMACS)

## Solution

Going to the resource page and looking about, the first part of the flag is `LITCTF{1_h0p3_y0u_didnt_s`. The second link redirects to a YT video, which I'm surprised is NOT a rickroll, and it seems looking through this video for one flag would be painful. The easier way is just to look through the slides published later, or realized LexMACS accidentally leaked the flag earlier.
