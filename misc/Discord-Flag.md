# misc/Discord Flag

## Chall

Go to our discord server https://discord.gg/k6yzFdZ for the flag~ We post the latest information and updates there so it's very important.
 

## Solution

We originally thought this was a trick to make us succumb to being Discord users, but it turns out they were being legit about it. A while before the CTF started, CodeTiger posted `LITCTF{L1T_1S_G0NNA_BE_S0_LIT_W1TH_Y0U_GUYS!}` in the announcements channel. Turns out, that was the flag!
