**Chall:**
I like the city! The flag is LITCTF{latitude,longtitude} rounded to the third decimal place. (Example: `LITCTF{42.444,-71.230}`)

**Solution:**
Inspecting the image, we see that a life preserver on the side that is written in both Chinese and Portuguese (though *some* brick on our team thought it was Spanish and just ignored it). Cool history lessons tell us this means the location is most likely somewhere in Macau.

**Flag:**
`LITCTF{}`
