# misc/Intro to LITCTF

## Challenge

Welcome to your first CTF Challenge! For this problem, you need to first read the [CTF Resource page](https://lit.lhsmathcs.org/ctfres) and find the first half of the flag :D. The second half of the flag can be found at our [Opening Ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QCkheqOp3s&ab_channel=LexMACS)!

## Solution

Going to the resource page and looking about, the first part of the flag can be found at the bottom: `LITCTF{1_h0p3_y0u_didnt_s`. The second link redirects to a YT video (which I'm surprised is NOT a rickroll), the Opening Ceremony livestream recording, and it seems looking through this video for one flag would be painful. The easier way is just to look through the [slides posted later](https://discord.com/channels/738848412912451695/738848412912451698/1000058022715998321), or to have been a good LITCTF participant, attending the Opening Ceremony and spotting the second half of the flag at [33:18](https://youtu.be/5QCkheqOp3s?t=1998): `k1p_0ur_op3n1ng_c3r3mony}`.
