# web/Kevin's Cookies

**Chall:**
Welcome to Kevin Zhu's [cookie store](http://litctf.live:31778/)! I heard he sells many super delicious cookies :yum:

**Solution:**
Web challenge + cookies in the name = probably abusing cookies. Opening the site reveals Kevin telling us that he will not give us cookies because we don't like them. This is a horrible accusation as I love to eat cookies, so I decided to investigate the cookies to figure out what happened. 

On Google Chrome, `Inspect -> Application -> Cookies -> http://litctf.live:31778` reveals a set of three cookies, including one named `likeCookie`. This is initially set as false, and setting it to true reveals the following message when the page is reloaded.
`Oh silly you. What do you mean you like a true cookie? I have 20 cookies numbered from 1 to 20, and all of them are made from super true authentic recipes.`

Calling the cookie a "true cookie" after I set the value to "true" must have meant that the value should've actually been a number. Brute forcing all the numbers from 1-20, the value `17` reveals that Kevin loves the 17th cookie too, and he gives us our tasty flag as a reward.
Oh and a cookie too which is tastier obviously.

**Flag:**
