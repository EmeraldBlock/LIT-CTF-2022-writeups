# web/Among Us

## Challenge

Hello! I am Polopopy, and my friends like to call me Ryan. I have an unhealthy ~~fetich~~obsession with Among Us, so I made [this website](http://litctf.live:31779/) to demonstrate my unyielding enthusiasm!

## Solution

Viewing the HTML code of the website doesn't reveal much. The only thing that might be of interest is the [sussy-yellow-amogus](http://litctf.live:31779/sussy-yellow-amogus) gif file, but the flag isn't in there either.

However, if we press F12 and go to the `Network` tab, we can see that the site makes a request for the [sussy-yellow-amogus](http://litctf.live:31779/sussy-yellow-amogus) file. Viewing the `Response Headers` section of this request, we can see this:
