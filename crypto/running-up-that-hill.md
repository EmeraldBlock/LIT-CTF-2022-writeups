# crypto/Running Up That Hill

## Chall

If I only could, I'd make a deal with god, and I'd get him to swap our places.

*This challenge also includes a zip file, which only contains [`challenge.txt`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xqQawB_pdjbodbIo4GGUjzrPxDnjv9V5/view?usp=sharing)

## Solution

Honestly, this challenge took us a while longer than it should have. The flavor text mentions swapping, and the challenge has a very unique name seemingly unrelated to the challenge, so doing some internet searching reveals there's actually a cipher called the [Hill Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_cipher), which uses some interesting matrix number theory to encrypt text. As per usual [dCode](https://www.dcode.fr/hill-cipher) is clutch, and inputting our given information into the website reveals our flag.
